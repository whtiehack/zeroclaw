# Official Channels And Fraud Prevention

This page is the evergreen security statement for community safety and impersonation defense.

## Fraud Warning

Scammers may impersonate ZeroClaw maintainers, contributors, or community members.

Assume fraud if someone claiming to represent ZeroClaw asks for:

- cryptocurrency transfers
- wallet access or seed phrases
- private financial information
- private credentials outside official security reporting flow

ZeroClaw maintainers do not request money or private wallet/financial credentials via direct messages.

## Official Sources Of Truth

Use these sources to verify announcements:

- GitHub repository: `zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw`
- GitHub Security policy and advisories: [../../SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md)

Treat third-party links and social posts as untrusted until confirmed in the GitHub repository.

## How To Verify Announcements

1. Check whether the same announcement exists in GitHub issues, PRs, releases, or docs.
2. Confirm the posting account is an expected project maintainer/org account.
3. Prefer links that originate from repository pages rather than forwarded DMs.

## Reporting Suspicious Activity

If you see impersonation attempts or scam outreach:

1. Do not engage or send funds/data.
2. Capture evidence (screenshots, usernames, URLs, timestamps).
3. Open a GitHub issue in `zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw` with sanitized details.

For vulnerability disclosure, use private reporting:

- Security policy: [../../SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md)
- Private report template: [private-vulnerability-report-template.md](private-vulnerability-report-template.md)
